							<p>On behalf of the Organizing Committee for the 42nd International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval (SIGIR 2019) we invite you to participate in the conference as a supporter or exhibitor.</p>
							
							<p>SIGIR is a major international forum for presentation of the latest state-of-the-art research and demonstration of new systems and methods for connecting people with information: from Web search engines, recommender systems, and social network technology to compelling applications in health, legal, educational, and other domains, research at SIGIR spans both academia and industry.</p>
							<p>As a top-tier international conference affiliated with the main computer science professional organization, the Association of Computing Machinery (ACM), SIGIR is attended by many of the world’s top researchers and practitioners who work in research areas that include information retrieval, data mining and machine learning, human-computer interaction, natural language processing, and more. The ACM SIGIR Conference is the gathering place for current and future leaders and innovators from all over the world to discuss and present the state of the art in connecting people with information.</p>
							<p>The conference also hosts top Ph.D. students from the most prestigious institutions in computer and information science, and will host a number of events bringing together academia and industry.</p>

							<p>We look forward to seeing you in Paris, France in 2019!</p>
